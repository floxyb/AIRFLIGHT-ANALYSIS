# AIRLINE FLIGHT-ANALYSIS
My first project on GITHUB, analysis on Flight Airline.
The dashboard provides a detailed analysis of air flight data, focusing on flight prices, durations, stops, classes, and airline performance. The dataset contains approximately 300.15K total flights with an average ticket price of $20.89K and an average flight duration of 12.22 hours. Notably, only 12% of flights are non-stop, indicating a strong preference for connecting flights among passengers.

👨‍✈️ Business Recommendations
Promote Business Class
Since business class generates higher revenue, airlines should focus on loyalty programs and premium packages.
Leverage Non-stop Flights
With 91.63% of revenue from non-stop flights, optimizing direct routes can increase profitability.
👨‍🚀 Price Optimization Strategy
Use dynamic pricing based on booking windows, as ticket revenue peaks when flights are booked closer to departure.
👨‍✈️ Focus on Top-Performing Flights
Flights like UK-706 and UK-772 can be marketed more aggressively.
Expand Vistara’s Model
Since Vistara dominates both revenue and volume, analyzing its operational model could help other airlines improve competitiveness.
The analysis highlights that Vistara and Air India dominate the market, non-stop business-class flights drive most of the revenue, and pricing strategies should consider booking timelines. Optimizing routes and leveraging premium services can significantly enhance profitability.
